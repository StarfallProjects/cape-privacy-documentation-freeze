# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are more than welcome and we're always looking for ideas!

This document will help you:

* [Run the docs locally](#run-the-docs-locally), allowing you to preview your work.
* [Contribute to the docs](#contribute-to-the-docs).
* [Understand the docs tooling](#understand-the-docs-tooling).


## Run the docs locally

Prerequisites:

* git
* Python 64bit (currently using 3.7 due to [Netlify limitations](https://github.com/netlify/build-image/blob/xenial/included_software.md)).
* pip
* venv

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/capeprivacy/documentation.git
```

2. In the `documentation` directory, create a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv):

```
python -m venv ./venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment. The exact command depends on your shell:

```
# Powershell
./venv/Scripts/activate.ps1

# Bash
. venv/Scripts/activate
```

4. Install the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Pydoc-markdown](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. To view the docs locally:

```
mkdocs serve
```

You can now view the docs at `localhost:8080`. 

Note that this does not autogenerate the latest code documentation. Refer to [Understand the docs tooling](#understand-the-docs-tooling) for detailed information on the documentation setup.

## Contribute to the docs

This section describes how to edit the handwritten docs website content.

The main branch is live. All work should happen on another branch.

Follow steps 1-4 from [Run the docs locally](#run-the-docs-locally) to be able to preview the docs locally.

### Submitting a pull request

To contribute, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) Cape Python, commit your changes, and [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

While you may be asked to make changes to your submission during the review process, we will work with you on this and suggest changes. Consider giving us [push rights to your branch](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/) so we can potentially also help via commits.

### Style and tone

Refer to the [Writing style and tone](https://github.com/capeprivacy/documentation/wiki/Writing-style-and-tone) page in our wiki.

## Understand the docs tooling

This section provides background information on the project setup and tooling. For instructions on how to contribute and run the docs site, refer to [Contribute to the docs](#contribute-to-the-docs).

> **Note:** the `cpdocs.sh` script assembles all the components described here. Most of the time you can just run this script. However, if you need to change the setup, use this section to understand how the components work together.

The documentation website comprises:

* Content written in Markdown, in the documentation repository. This includes most of the introductory material, best practices guides, and similar. 
* Content written as code comments or docstrings in the Cape Privacy code. To include this in the website, we use git submodules, a tool for each language to generate markdown from code comments, and a Bash script to bring everything together.


### Cape Python autogeneration

1. The [Cape Python](https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape-python) repo is a submodule in this project. 
2. We use [Pydoc-markdown](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown) to generate Markdown files from the Cape Python docstrings. Use `pydoc-markdown.yml` to configure the tool, and set up the navigation.
3. The [Monorepo](https://github.com/spotify/mkdocs-monorepo-plugin) plugin allows us to include the site generated by Pydoc-markdown in our docs site. This is configured in the main `mkdocs.yml`.
