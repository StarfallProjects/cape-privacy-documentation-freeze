# Running transformations

You can choose where in your workflow to run your transformation scripts.

Cape Privacy recommends:

* Run your scripts early in your workflow.
* Import your data, then run the transformations just before submitting it to your [TODO:data processing/model]. This ensures you only run the transformations once.
