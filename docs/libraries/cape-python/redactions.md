# Redactions

Redactions are functions that alter your data. Unlike [transformations](/libraries/cape-python/transformations/), which modify but preserve data, redactions delete your data.

Cape Python has two built-in redaction functions. This document describes what they do, and provides an example of how to use each redaction in your policy.

!!! warning
